 System requirements
---------------------

 - adtn-lib. Follow the installation instructions available at https://github.com/SeNDA-UAB/aDTN-platform
 - Java SE Development Kit 6 (jdk) onwards
 - Apache Ant 1.9 onwards



 Settings
----------

For a Java application to be able to use the adtn platform for sending and/or receiving  messages, it must be launched by a user belonging to the adtn user group. Notice that to add the user alice to the adtn group you just need to execute the following command 'sudo usermod -aG adtn "alice"'. Stop and relaunch all bash terminals to ensure they are aware of your user being a member of adtn user group. 


 Running a test using the examples
-----------------------------------

Build.xml is set to provide a task for running the Receiver and another for running the Sender and another for running the Ping. Previously you need to compile all of them with: 'ant compile'.

To perform a test, run the Receiver in a platform: 'ant runReceiver'.

And run the Sender in another platform (or the same platform): 'ant runSender'. 



 Deploying an application using the adtn communication library
-------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT!! Inform your future users that they must belong to the adtn user group in order to use your application.

 Troubleshooting
-----------------

If your application have a behaviour similar at:

When you send a message this is not send.
If a call to receive is not blocking you application when no message is received.
If you see a segmentation fault error.

Your user is not in the adtn group, you need to add it to run your application as seen in Settings section.
