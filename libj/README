This is the first release of the library for Java applications to communicate using aDTN platforms.

An aDTN platform installation is required for its correct execution.

Requires Java 1.7 onwards.

Execute "bash compileAdtnlibj.sh" on the same platform machine. Then, use the content of adtnlibj-0.1-examples.zip to run an example and start coding your own application.
