INSTALLING THE ADTN PLATFORM
============================

The aDTN platform has some dependences that are listed below. These are ubuntu packages:

	make
	cmake
	libssl-dev
	libsqlite3-dev
	libprocps0-dev / libproc-dev (change procps to proc at watchdog/CMakeLists.txt)
	gcc

Uthash is a header file that can be found at http://http://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/. It is provided with the code so it doesn't need to be installed. It and can be found in common/include. The license of this file is BSD and can be found in the file uthash.h.

To install in the default directory (/usr/local):

cmake ./
make 
make install

---------------------------------------
To specify the installation path:
---------------------------------------
cmake ./ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation path>
make
make install

---------------------------------------
To specify the build type (default release):
---------------------------------------
cmake ./ -DBTYPE={Debug, Release, ''}

---------------------------------------
To set profiling (i.e: Compile tests):
---------------------------------------
cmake ./ -DPROF={True, False, ''}

Note: The parameters such as Debug, Release, True, False... ARE NOT case sensitive. So, enjoy! ;)

Once installed, update the dynamic libraries cache (if the library is installed in a non standard path, it have to be added to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable or included in the ldconfig config files) :

sudo ldconfig

And modify /etc/adtn.ini to specify the data directory, it must be writable to the adtn platform processes.
