The basic functionallity of the platform is detailed below:

 + Allow neighbour discovery in an oportunistic network
 + Allow message interchange in an oportunistic network
 + Add resilience to nodes disconection
 + Add resilience to long delays in the network
 + Allows the messages to carry routing, prioritzation and lifetime codes that can be executed in each node. This way different apps with diferent needs can work over the same platform
 + Provides a RIT (Routing information table) in each node.
 + The routing code can decide the next hop based on RIT or environment information
 + The prioritzation time can decide the priority of a message based on RIT or environment information
 + The lifetime of a message can be decided based on RIT or environment information

 The API for developers allow easy development of applications over the platform. The API is based on sockets system calls. Documentation of how to use this API can be found in "docs" folder. The API needs the platform working on the running system.

 For information about how to install the aDTN platform read the file INSTALL.

 For quick information about how to use the API read the HOWTO file.

 For information about the work status and what remains to be done read the TODO file.
