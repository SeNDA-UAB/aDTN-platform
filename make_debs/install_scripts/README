The scripts must have a predefined structure and a predefined name in order to
be able to execute them from dpkg in the deb package.

This predefined structure is:

* Script name must be {pre|post}{install|remove}-pak
  (i.e: preinstall-pak, preremove-pak, postinstall-pak and postremove-pak)

* The script must return an exiting code. 
  exit 0 if everything was fine, else exit with something different than 0.

NOTE: In order to be consistent with the constant variables from the installation
and deinstallation process. A constants file is defined. This is concatenated with
the corresponding post install in order to have all of them the same constants.

This behaviour is defined in deb_platform.sh and deb_lib.sh scripts. For more information take
a look at them.

NOTE 1: The folder structure is splitted into platform and lib (adtn api) in order
to be able to cut out the behaviour of the installation process.
