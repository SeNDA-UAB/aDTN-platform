The scripts must have a predefined structure and a predefined name in order to
be able to execute them from dpkg in the deb package.

This predefined structure is:

* Script name must be {pre|post}{install|remove}-pak
  (i.e: preinstall-pak, preremove-pak, postinstall-pak and postremove-pak)

* The script must return an exiting code. 
  exit 0 if everything was fine, else exit with something different than 0.

NOTE: In order to be consistent with the constant variables from the installation
and deinstallation process. A constants file is defined where is needed, in this case
in the platform folder. This is concatenated with the corresponding script in order 
to have all of them the same constants and hence, be consistent.

This behaviour is defined in deb_platform.sh script. For more information take
a look at it.

NOTE 1: The folder structure is splitted into several parts (platform, lib and examples)
in order to be able to differentiate the behaviour of the installation process.
